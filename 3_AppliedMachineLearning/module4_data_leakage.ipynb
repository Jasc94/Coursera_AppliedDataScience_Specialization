    "# Data Leakage\n",
    "\n",
    "- It describes the situation where the data we're using to train the machine learning algorithm happens to include unexpected extra information about the very thing we're trying yo predict.\n",
    "- It occurs anytime that information is introduced about the target label or value during training that would not legitimately be available during actual use\n",
    "- If the model performance is too good to be true, it probably is due to \"giveaway\" features\n",
    "- Leakage can cause the model to learn a sub-optimal solution that does much worse in actual deployment than a model without leak.\n",
    "- It is one of the most serious and widespread problems in data mining and machine learning\n",
